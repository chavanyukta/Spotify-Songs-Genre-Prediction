## Project Overview

As a data scientist at Spotify, this project aims to predict the genre of a song based on its audio attributes such as danceability, speechiness, tempo, and release year. The goal is to help Spotify enhance user experience by improving song recommendations and targeted advertising.

---

## Executive Summary

- The dataset was reduced to 1,000 songs per genre due to computational limits.
- Exploratory analysis revealed significant differences in popularity and speechiness among genres.
- Three classification models were built and compared:  
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Random Forest (RF)  
- The Random Forest model (100 trees, 5 levels) had the highest accuracy of 50.4%.
- The model can help Spotify enhance its music recommendation system.

## Model Training & Evaluation

- Linear Discriminant Analysis  
- K-Nearest Neighbors
